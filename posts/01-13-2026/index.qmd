What is a model?

Our reading for next time defines models in science.  This is a hard read but it is the only reading for the week.

[Models in Science from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/models-science/)

We will pay extra attention to sections 1, 3, and 5.2.

The class plan:

1. Discuss the syllabus, deliverables, and requirements
2. An overview of the course and mutual introductions.
3. A brief discussion of models to set the foundations for Thursday.

Your assignment for next time:

1. Do the reading.
2. Collect at least three questions and the answers provided by Google Gemini about references in the reading that were unfamiliar.  If you did not run across at least three unfamiliar references, you need a more advanced course.
