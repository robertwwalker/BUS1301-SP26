## Outline

- Readings: Data Types and Chapter 1

## What is Data?

[Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/data) defines data as: 

![data](./data.png)

+ facts or numbers.  
+ in electronic form.  
+ stored and used by a computer.   


## FBS: What is a spreadsheet?

+ Google Sheets: rows, columns, sheets

![Sheet](./Screenshot 2026-01-20 at 11.05.24 AM.png)

## Finding Data

- Gemini.  
- [tidytuesday](https://rfordatascience.github.io/tidytuesday/) [in .csv]
- Kaggle
- UCI Machine Learning


## Examples

[Datasaurus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-10-13/datasaurus.csv)

+ [on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1udx92vssF7I0sY_CiUVQ3Fta_xKL-eeQ8ez7M7f9QP0/edit?usp=sharing).

## What is a variable?

Something that varies.  Distinguished from constants.

## Classifying Data

From the above definition, anything we can put in a spreadsheet [and that may be too limiting] is data.  To classify it, we will need some categories. 


- *The spreadsheet may impose character limits or the like, that is a programming choice and not tied to definition.*.  

## Classifying Data I: Quantative vs. Qualitative

Literally numbers vs. non-numbers.  But it is not quite that simple.

+ There are numbers that are not numerical, e.g. Social security numbers.  There is some, but not much, encoded information and there is little we can do with them.   

+ Your Willamette Student ID

## Quantitative Data: Levels of Measurement

Four categories:   

+ Nominal.  (No order and no arithmetic)
+ Ordinal.  (Order, no arithmetic)
+ Interval scale.  (Addition and subtraction, no multiplication and division)
+ Ratio scale.   (All arithmetic)

## Nominal Data

Names
ID numbers

## Ordered Data

Ranks
Medals
Satisfaction
Likert scales

## Interval data

The `year` example in the Primer.

## Ratio scale

The `duration` example in the primer.

## Distinction: Unit of Analysis

What are the units?

Sometimes, this is singular

Sometimes, it is a combination

Popular units:    

1. `cross-sectional` units [people, countries, products]
2. time periods -- time series
3. panel data is a combination of units and time. [Multiple time series or multiple cross-sections over time]

[Consider this example](https://robertwwalker.github.io/posts/HumanRightsTable/)

## A Data Taxonomy

+ Generally column-centric.  
+ Variables in columns.  
+ Units in rows.
