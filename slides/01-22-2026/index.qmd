## What is Data?

[Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/data) defines data as: 

![data](./data.png)

+ facts or numbers.  
+ in electronic form.  
+ stored and used by a computer.   

## What is a variable?

Something that varies.  Distinguished from constants.

## Classifying Data

- Quantative vs. Qualitative.   
   + Nominal.  (No order and no arithmetic).  
   + Ordinal.  (Order, no arithmetic).  
   + Interval scale.  (Addition and subtraction, no multiplication and division).  
   + Ratio scale.   (All arithmetic).  

## `Data Organization in Spreadsheets`

+ Google Sheets: rows, columns, sheets

## How to Organize Spreadsheets?

- Be consistent.    
- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD.  
- No empty cells.  
- One thing per cell.   
- Single rectangle [rows as units, columns as variables, header row].  
- Create a data dictionary.   
- Do not include calculations in raw data.   
- Fonts and color hides data.   
- Name things well.   
- Make backups.   
- Use validation.   
- Save the data in plain text.   

## FBS vs. DBMS

- File Based System: spreadsheets.   
- Database Management Systems: an interface between files and users.   

## More on DBMS

## DBMS Architectures and Levels

- 1 tier: Local database and application.   
- 2 tier: Database on server, client with user and application
- 3 tier: Application server and database server, client with user and application.    

## DBMS Types

## Takeaways

FBS is usually how things start; structure is expensive and ex ante required.

**The challenge**: When to transition?

In many ways, the distinction comes down to when to no longer trust organic collaboration by imposing structure.

# Musings

- Much of this distinction may soon become moot.   
- AI makes mistakes and those could be awful.
