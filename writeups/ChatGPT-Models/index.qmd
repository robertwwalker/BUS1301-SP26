# TL;DR

ChatGPT, from OpenAI, is an extremely powerful AI tool.  I will use it here to help me think about the use of models.  A [link to the interaction](https://chatgpt.com/share/69685363-8ef0-8000-abeb-57e316b74374).

If you’d like, I can also:
 + Condense this into a one-page teaching handout
 + Add a column comparing predictive vs. explanatory models
 + Tailor it for a specific field or course level
