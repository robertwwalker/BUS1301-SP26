# TL;DR

Gemini, from Google, is an extremely powerful AI tool.  I will use it here to help me think about the use of models.

## Prompt: 

1. how are models used in academic disciplines?  give an example or two of common models in at least 20 academic disciplines in a formatted table of markdown code with a linked reference for each model that provides more extensive detail and a column that includes whether the model is predictive or explanatory

2. This response is great except that I want you to provide the response in its entirety as markdown code, not rendered.

Models are the primary tools scholars use to bridge the gap between abstract theory and the complex reality of the world. In academic disciplines, a **model** is a simplified representation of a system, concept, or process.

Scholars use them for three primary purposes:
1.  **Explanation:** To isolate specific variables and understand *how* or *why* a phenomenon occurs (e.g., how neurons fire).
2.  **Prediction:** To forecast future states or unseen data based on current parameters (e.g., predicting the spread of a virus).
3.  **Simulation:** To create "sandbox" environments where theoretical scenarios can be tested without real-world risk (e.g., economic crash simulations).

The following table outlines common models across 20 distinct academic disciplines.

### Would you like me to...

Generate a Python script or R code to simulate one of the simpler predictive models, such as the **SIR Model** or **Lotka-Volterra**, so you can see how the variables interact in real-time?
