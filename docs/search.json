    "text": "CADDS\nThe data set presented is designed to represent a sample of 1,000 DDS consumers (which provides a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5% for this 250,000 consumer population). The data set includes six variables (i.e., fields) which are: ID, age cohort/age (binned/unbinned), gender, expenditures, and ethnicity. NB: The data set originated from DDS’s Client Master File. In order to remain in compliance with California State Legislation, the data have been altered to protect the rights and privacy of specific individual consumers. The provided data set is based on actual attributes of consumers.\nID is the unique identification code for each consumer. It is similar to a social security number and used for identification purposes.\nAge cohort/age is a key variable in the case exercise. While age is a legal basis for discrimination in many situations, age is not an attribute that would be considered in a discrimination claim for this particular population. The purpose of providing funds to those with developmental disabilities is to help them live like those without disabilities. As consumers get older, their financial needs increase as they move out of their parent’s home, etc. Therefore, it is expected that expenditures for older consumers will be higher than for the younger consumers.\nWe have included both binned (Age cohort) and unbinned (Age) variables to represent a consumer’s age. The binned age variable is represented in the data set as six age cohorts. Each consumer is assigned to an age cohort based on their years since birth. The six cohorts include: 0-5 years old, 6-12, 13-17, 18-21, 22-50, and 51+. The cohorts are established based on the amount of financial support typically required during a particular life phase.\nThe 0-5 cohort (preschool age) has the fewest needs and requires the least amount of funding. For the 6-12 cohort (elementary school age) and 13-17 (high school age), a number of needed services are provided by schools. The 18-21 cohort is typically in a transition phase as the consumers begin moving out from their parents’ homes into community centers or living on their own. The majority of those in the 22-50 cohort no longer live with their parents but may still receive some support from their family. Those in the 51+ cohort have the most needs and require the most amount of funding because they are living on their own or in community centers and often have no living parents.\nGender is included in the data set as another variable to consider because it is an attribute on which many discrimination cases are based.\nExpenditures variable represents the annual expenditures the State spends on each consumer in supporting these individuals and their families. It is important that students realize this is the amount each consumer receives from the State. Expenditures include services such as: respite for their families, psychological services, medical expenses, transportation, and costs related to housing such as rent (especially for adult consumers living outside their parent’s home).\nEthnicity is the key demographic variable in the data set as it pertains to the case. Eight ethnic groups are represented in the data set. These groups reflect the demographic profile of the State of California. Our key area of interest will become Hispanic and White, non-Hispanic comparisons."

    "section": "1. How Models Represent the World",
    "text": "1. How Models Represent the World\nModels are like maps or pictures—they represent something else. Philosophers usually divide them into two main types based on what they represent.\n\nModels of Phenomena\nThese are models of things or events in the real world. * Examples: The Bohr model of the atom, a scale model of a bridge, or a computer model of the weather. * The Big Question: How does a model (which is just an object or an idea) represent a real phenomenon? It’s similar to asking how a painting represents a landscape.\n\n\nModels of Data\nScientific data often comes from observations that are “messy.” There might be errors or irrelevant details. * What they do: A “model of data” is a cleaned-up version of that information. * Example: If you plot points on a graph and they are scattered, you might draw a smooth curve through them. That smooth curve is the model of the data. It helps scientists see the pattern rather than just the noise.\n\n\nDifferent Styles of Models\nScientists use different styles to represent things, just like artists use different styles (like realism or abstract art).\n\nScale Models: These are just smaller (or larger) physical copies of the target.\n\nExample: A wooden model of a car or a plastic model of a DNA molecule. They look like the real thing but might be made of different materials.\n\nIdealized Models: These models simplify reality to make it easier to understand.\n\n“Stripping Away” (Aristotelian): You ignore details that don’t matter for your problem. For example, when studying planetary orbits, you might treat a planet as a simple dot with mass, ignoring its mountains and oceans.\n“Distorting” (Galilean): You imagine a world that physically cannot exist to test a theory. For example, imagining a surface with zero friction or a market where everyone knows everything.\n\nAnalogical Models: These use a familiar object to explain something new.\n\nExample: Describing the nucleus of an atom as a “liquid drop.” It isn’t actually a drop of liquid, but it behaves like one in some ways.",

But what is a scientific model made of?\n\nPhysical Objects: Some are real material things, like the model of a bridge used in a wind tunnel.\nFictional Objects: Some philosophers argue that models are like characters in a book (like Sherlock Holmes). They don’t exist in the real world, but we can still study them and learn true things about them.\nMath and Sets: Many scientists view models as mathematical structures (sets of equations and rules).\nDescriptions: Some simply say a model is just a detailed description of a system.",

    "text": "3. Learning with Models (Epistemology)\nWe use models because we can’t always test the real world. We can’t easily crash real trains to test safety, so we use models. Learning happens in two steps:\n\nLearning about the Model: We run experiments or simulations on the model itself. For example, we might run a computer program to see how a digital disease spreads.\nTranslating to Reality: We take what we learned from the model and apply it to the real world. If the model bridge collapses in the wind tunnel, we assume the real bridge might collapse in a real storm.",

It says a “theory” is a set of sentences or math equations, and a “model” is just a way to interpret those equations.\nThe Semantic View: This is the more modern view. It says that the theory is actually a collection of models. For example, “Classical Mechanics” isn’t just a list of rules; it’s the family of all the different models (pendulums, planetary orbits, billiard balls) that follow those rules.",

In academic disciplines, a model is a simplified representation of a system, concept, or process.\nScholars use them for three primary purposes: 1. Explanation: To isolate specific variables and understand how or why a phenomenon occurs (e.g., how neurons fire). 2. Prediction: To forecast future states or unseen data based on current parameters (e.g., predicting the spread of a virus). 3. Simulation: To create “sandbox” environments where theoretical scenarios can be tested without real-world risk (e.g., economic crash simulations).\nThe following table outlines common models across 20 distinct academic disciplines.\n\nCommon Academic Models\n\n\n\nDiscipline\nModel Name\nUse/Description\nType\nReference\n\n\n\n\n1.
