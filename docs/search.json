The items in parentheses are deviations from the mean; covariance is the product of those deviations from the mean.

For this reason, we use a normalized form of covariance known as correlation, often just \\rho.\n\\rho_{xy} = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(x_{i} - \\overline{x})(y_{i} - \\overline{y})}{s_{x}s_{y}}\nCorrelation is a normed measure; it varies between -1 and 1.",

But we cannot really know whether or not it holds. But if it does:\n\nSlopes and intercepts are t, as are their confidence intervals.\n\nSums of squares have ratios defined by F.\n\nPredictions have t averages and normal intervals.\n\nAll founded upon the sum of squared errors being \\chi^2.\n\n\nThis core idea of explaining variance or unpacking a black box is the core question to virtually all machine learning and modelling.\n\nThe capital asset pricing model.",
